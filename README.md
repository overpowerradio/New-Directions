Solutions for everyday people, from everyday people

Site Objective: To give people suffering tribulations a platform where they can connect with others who have been through what they're going through and survived. 

Inspiration: To provide a holistic app that connects people, who have been diagnosed with cancer, with cancer survivors who applied holistic practices to conquer their disease. Connecting with someone who relates, transcends empathy from those who don't really know what it's like to be in your position. It can be inspirational, offering guidance and hope to influence positive decision making for a stroner future.

Developed Features: We're expanding the platform to individuals suffering wider range of difficulties, who will benefit from connecting with someone who has survived what they're going through (addiction, domestic violence victims, parenting children with special needs, ex-cons trying to adapt to society and gain employment, etc.)
